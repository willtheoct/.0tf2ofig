All of my scripts are intended to be used alongside Yttrium's Viewmodel Mod,
Which handles all of the viewmodel hiding for me (it's much more reliable than any script)

Feel free to use any of these however you like.


Installation Instructions:
	1. Find your "cfg" folder, usually found here:
		"Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\cfg"
	2. Copy paste any configs you think you will use/need
	
	Note: If you intend on using one of the class configs you will need scoreboard and nullmove to go with them
	Note: Read through the configs if you intend on using them to make sure you know what they're going to do
	Note: Any lines starting with a "//" means they are "commented out", meaning the game will not try to execute that line.
	Note: SET YOUR CONFIG.CFG TO "READ ONLY" BEFORE USING ANYTHING (makes uninstalling these scripts as easy as deleting them)
	

Uninstalling Instructions:
	1. Open any config file you want to uninstall and delete all of the code inside, leaving a blank .cfg file.
	2. If you want to go back to default, factory tf2 settings, type "exec config_default" inside TF2 console.
	3. If you want to go back to your old settings (assuming you set config.cfg to readonly), type "exec config".
